The Extra.Guard library provides a means for verifying preconditions on function
arguments. The methods exposed for doing so return the validated parameter
whenever it does not violate the precondition that is being tested, otherwise an
exception is thrown.

## Installation

The Extra.Guard library can be installed using
[NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Extra.Guard/).

## Usage
